This is 2PN
===========

2PN is a popular single-player game for Web and mobile. It's a kind of puzzle game and of course playable
                for each age class. <br>
                Basically, <i>2048</i> presents with a 4x4 grid. When you start the game, there will be two “tiles” on the
                grid, each displaying the number 2 or 4. You hit the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles around —
                and also to generate new tiles, which will also be valued at 2 or 4. When two equal tiles collide, they
                combine to give you one greater tile that displays their sum. The more you do this, obviously, the higher
                the tiles get and the more crowded the board becomes. Your objective is to reach 2048 before the board fills
                up.
